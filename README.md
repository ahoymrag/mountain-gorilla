# 🦍 Mountain Gorilla Command Center (MGCC)

*A playful fintech-inspired CLI that manages your AI assistants ("bots") as collectible, trainable agents—complete with unique blockchain superpowers, wallet tracking, and strategy automation.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Mountain Gorilla Command Center (MGCC)** is a minimal, ASCII-driven command-line interface (CLI) inspired by classic Pokédex-style collectible games. MGCC treats each of your bots as distinct, specialized agents that you can summon, train, and deploy to manage fintech tasks, wallets, and blockchain interactions. Leveraging the design patterns and philosophy of ApeWorX's **Silverback** bot framework and the simplicity of **Vyper**, MGCC allows rapid prototyping of powerful automated finance strategies in a playful, interactive environment.
